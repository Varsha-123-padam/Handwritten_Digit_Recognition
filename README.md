# Handwritten_Digit_Recognition
This project demonstrates a real-time digit recognition system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model deployed through an intuitive Streamlit web app. Users can either draw digits on an interactive canvas or upload digit images (PNG/JPG) for instant classification.
